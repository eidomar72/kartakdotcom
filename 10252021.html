<div class="header1">Weekly Lessons Learned In The Stock Market</div>
<p>WEEK OF 10/25/2021</p>

<ol>
    <li> Low float/ small cap market started off hot on Monday and started fading away towards the end of the week. Some large cap names started perking and gaining back some bull momentum on Thursday and Friday.</li>
<p></p>
    <li>Continuation from last week’s themes; IPO’s and SPACs. Sympathy stocks played out well. New themes that ran this week were Electric Vehicle, Augmented Reality, Drone and Solar Panel companies. Most of momentum stocks behaved similarly. Stock would be triggered, it would run, short term flippers would sell, buyers would chase the break for a second round of moment run.</li>
<p></p>
    <li>Biggest lesson learned from this type of market is to not chase runners for the sake of hoping for another run. Teach yourself to have patience and know when to enter and exit a trade.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Not all trades are going to go as planned, especially in this market, once the run happens scalp out of the trade and take profits.</li>
      </ul>
<p></p>
    <li>Some of the nice sympathy plays that ran this week:
      <ul>
        <li>$RCAT and $UAVS with VISL running.</li>
        <li>$EQOS following $BKKT multiple runs throughout the week.</li>
        <li>$CIDM off of $GNUS.</li>
        <li>$JOB off $PIXY’s run.</li>
        <li>$FAMI off of $METX.</li>
        <li>$NSPR off of $IINN monster run.</li>
        <li>$FRSX odd $LIDR.</li>
        <li>Most of EV names (including $AYRO, $FSR…) followed $LCID latest pr and $TSLA’s ATH price.</li>
      </ul>
<p></p>
  <li>On Tuesday 10/26 - $VIX, $SPY and $QQQ ran together at around 10:00ish which usually means divergence; something will give up eventually. $SPY ended up going red intra-day (but bounced back up and then back to red at end of day).</li>
</ol>
