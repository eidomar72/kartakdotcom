                Know why the tickers gapped. Pull out your favorite handy-dandy News Website. Everyone needs to have a news website that they can trust. Mine are Thefly.com, Stocktitan.net and Finviz.com to look for press-release headlines and articles. Start going through reasoning why your watchlist stocks gapped. Understand whether the headline is legit or just bullshit. If it’s legit, then start planning your play in favor of the headline with supply and demand zones, support and resistance lines and how the stock last trader when it had volume (when it last gapped). Most of the time it repeats its previous action. If the headline seems bullshit or if the stock is gapping on no news, there’s probably is an underlying reasoning…do some more digging and know what stock is susceptible to previous pumps and dumps (here I check simply check Twitter to connect dots).<br><br>
                I like looking through any overnight Bankruptcy and Private Placement news and SEC filings. Each of these have their own style of trade. I think every trader needs to know how to trade bankruptcy and private placement offerings. If you don’t want to, then go grab coffee. Take a small mental break and prep talk yourself<br><br>
                Not so much of a step but this is a good time where I go through my main trading rules; cutting losses, no revenge trading, A+ setups only, trades are taken only when I have a plan, it’s okay to end the day with zero trades, etc...whatever rules that keep your trading consistent. You know the drill…

      <a class="Rectanlge-content-About" target="_blank">I’m nothing more than a risk taker. A mere image of what a passionate yet lost man is. Being lost is nothing more than a powerful agent to the uninitiated…but since you are here, you and I are both initiated, are we?
        <br><br>We’re both fighting like appalled warriors with nothing holding us back. Admirable but mistaken…The only difference between us is that you think risk is your ally, but you merely adopted that darkness. My guts are smeared with it, molded by it. I didn’t see the light until I was already a man, by then it was nothing to me but blinding. <br><br>
This darkness will eventually betray us because it belongs to them. But I will show you where I built my home, so you can too. To them, you're just a freak, like me!<br><br>
Welcome to the dark side.<br><br>
Best Regards,<br>
