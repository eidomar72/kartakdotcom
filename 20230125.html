                If you thought that blue is blue, pink is pink, and green is green. You would be right...but if you thought that Microsoft giving a terrible guidance for the upcoming market; would result in the market dumping (keeping in mind that Microsoft is the second biggest company in the US by market cap)…THEN YOU WERE WRONG.<br><br>
                As per usual, the market does one of those ‘terrible market data, is good for the market’ and rips all short traders face off squeezing the lifeless veins out of their body as they squeal out of fear and greed to add to a terribly managed short position. Oh well, market is gonna do what the market is gonna do. Can’t complain really, since I saw it coming. Or may be I went long because by nature I go against the market trend and it somehow worked out for me. We’ll never know. But hey, green is green. Not to worry, they’ll eventually take away my profits from today, just a matter of time I slip up.

                It does feel like kind of wrong to be the right side for once, days like today my instinct is to keep adding to a short position and pray that the market dumps out of empathy to thou self. Until the next bad guidance. Happy Friday!

      <a class="Rectanlge-content-About" target="_blank">I’m nothing more than a risk taker. A mere image of what a passionate yet lost man is. Being lost is nothing more than a powerful agent to the uninitiated…but since you are here, you and I are both initiated, are we?
        <br><br>We’re both fighting like appalled warriors with nothing holding us back. Admirable but mistaken…The only difference between us is that you think risk is your ally, but you merely adopted that darkness. My guts are smeared with it, molded by it. I didn’t see the light until I was already a man, by then it was nothing to me but blinding. <br><br>
This darkness will eventually betray us because it belongs to them. But I will show you where I built my home, so you can too. To them, you're just a freak, like me!<br><br>
Welcome to the dark side.<br><br>
Best Regards,<br>
