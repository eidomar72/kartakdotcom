                My plan for the week is to do the very opposite of what my brain tells me to do. I’ve always wondered if there’s a broker that allows you to execute the opposite of the trade orders you place. I’d be rolling in dough covered in honey. I’d retire Winnie the Pooh and Bully Bull. Anyway, that plan lasted only ten minutes. My body was taken over by my impulsive greed and fear of losing a position to market makers. It’s like I blank out when the market opens and lose all sense of veracity. <br><br>
                So while I was blanked out and busy looking for the appropriate put contract to buy when the market eventually shows a top, the market rallied to the goddamn moon. Another rally that I will miss. I assumed that once the SPY reached the 400 level, it would be sold off again. But to my surprise (I like how I’m always surprised to lose money even though it’s a normal occurrence), it squeezed perma-bears to the very last drop of greed. <br><br>
                The bear inside of me, that refuses to hibernate when the market is in a bull rally, insisted that I double down on a losing short position. For some strange reason, and to my surprise, I refused. This might have been a slip-up on the market makers' side; they let me ride an upside move at noon. They might have been out for lunch and taken my trading positions off their screen. Just when I thought going against my instinct would work, Winnie the Pooh, living rent-free in my greedy heart, was right about an afternoon sell off…that I missed. Market makers were definitely watching my screen when that happened.

      <a class="Rectanlge-content-About" target="_blank">I’m nothing more than a risk taker. A mere image of what a passionate yet lost man is. Being lost is nothing more than a powerful agent to the uninitiated…but since you are here, you and I are both initiated, are we?
        <br><br>We’re both fighting like appalled warriors with nothing holding us back. Admirable but mistaken…The only difference between us is that you think risk is your ally, but you merely adopted that darkness. My guts are smeared with it, molded by it. I didn’t see the light until I was already a man, by then it was nothing to me but blinding. <br><br>
This darkness will eventually betray us because it belongs to them. But I will show you where I built my home, so you can too. To them, you're just a freak, like me!<br><br>
Welcome to the dark side.<br><br>
Best Regards,<br>
