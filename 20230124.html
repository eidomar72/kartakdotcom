                One confusing day, pretty boring action, with not much range in either direction. With all of this choppiness, I was craving a fatoush salad. These kinds of days are called Pac-Man days. Algos are eating up both long and short premiums. Liquidation both ways means you’re losing money, whatever position you get into. Fighting the trend and being hopeful for the market to sway in my favor is what I would typically do, but you shouldn’t. This is just one of my strategies for losing money and is very helpful if you don’t feel like heading to your local casino. It saves you the cost of transportation. However, if you do decide to spend the money on a flight, may I suggest that you increase the size of your position? <br><br>
                To cover up my sorrow over how much money I fed Pac-Man, I drew a ghost. <br><br>

                And then I realized the chart also looked like an old-school Batman logo. .<br><br>
                As I write this, I’ve already ordered a fatoush salad. complements today’s action and creates some kind of harmony with the market. Maybe that’s what Bruce Lee meant by "be water"—you put water into a cup, and it becomes the cup. Or was it, "you are what you eat"?

      <a class="Rectanlge-content-About" target="_blank">I’m nothing more than a risk taker. A mere image of what a passionate yet lost man is. Being lost is nothing more than a powerful agent to the uninitiated…but since you are here, you and I are both initiated, are we?
        <br><br>We’re both fighting like appalled warriors with nothing holding us back. Admirable but mistaken…The only difference between us is that you think risk is your ally, but you merely adopted that darkness. My guts are smeared with it, molded by it. I didn’t see the light until I was already a man, by then it was nothing to me but blinding. <br><br>
This darkness will eventually betray us because it belongs to them. But I will show you where I built my home, so you can too. To them, you're just a freak, like me!<br><br>
Welcome to the dark side.<br><br>
Best Regards,<br>
