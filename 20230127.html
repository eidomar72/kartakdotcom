                Winnie the Pooh sees a big jar of honey. Pooh hasn’t eaten in a while and is hungry. Pooh is very greedy, impatient, and addicted to honey. He can't wait to dip his finger into that jar, but every time he tries, a big bully of a bull appears out of nowhere and summersaults the goddamn jar into oblivion. <br><br>
                To summarize this week, we started off with bad guidance from Microsoft, followed by bad guidance from IBM, and then a major miss and excess supply problem from Intel. The market was disrupted by the data, but somehow it still found buyers to lift the market higher. We passed through major resistance levels on the SPY and DOW like butter. Ah, I’d kill for a honey-and-butter croissant. <br><br>
                Towards the end of the week, we had a couple more misses in earnings and good numbers from Tesla. This sparked a fire in the EV names, sending the entire basket through another pumping cycle. Await the ever-coming blog for the dump. <br><br>
                The EV basket includes LCID, AYRO, SOLO, QS, SUNW, PLUG, NIO, LI, CLSK, PCG, BLNK, LAC, and SPI. It's only a matter of time before they become homes for a new set of bag holders. Dare I say it, the swing trading, furus pumping, and bag holders’ season has arrived. This is when golems get out of their mothers' basements and dump all their hard-earned money into someone else’s pocket. This is when a single tweet, a mere recommendation tweeted by a "non-financial advisor," can cause a follower’s addiction to surface and effortlessly cause them to lose their money. <br><br>
                Long story short, the market rallied on Friday (Jan 27th) and ended with a nice profit taking downtrend in the last hour. In other words, they opened the jar of honey and are daring pooh to stick his hand in there.

      <a class="Rectanlge-content-About" target="_blank">I’m nothing more than a risk taker. A mere image of what a passionate yet lost man is. Being lost is nothing more than a powerful agent to the uninitiated…but since you are here, you and I are both initiated, are we?
        <br><br>We’re both fighting like appalled warriors with nothing holding us back. Admirable but mistaken…The only difference between us is that you think risk is your ally, but you merely adopted that darkness. My guts are smeared with it, molded by it. I didn’t see the light until I was already a man, by then it was nothing to me but blinding. <br><br>
This darkness will eventually betray us because it belongs to them. But I will show you where I built my home, so you can too. To them, you're just a freak, like me!<br><br>
Welcome to the dark side.<br><br>
Best Regards,<br>
