This is done through manipulation of Q-codes which denote the form of treatment in which a product was used. The aim is for all treatments using MiMedx products to be coded as \u201cwound care\u201d in order to fraudulently maximize reimbursement. This type of Medicare fraud is referred to as \u2018up-coding\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to this Viceroy present recent court filings and emails showing that MiMedx engaged in illegal settlement terms in its legal actions against former employees. MiMedx has sent legal material to former employees requesting that they do not contact regulatory authorities and has stipulated in its settlement agreements that former employees retract their statements to any regulatory body. This is a violation of the United States Code of Federal Regulations.<\/p>\n<p>As a reminder of MiMedx selective statements to its investors, it\u2019s by no coincidence that MiMedx are now blatantly cloaking their conduct in public courts relating to former employee proceedings on confidentiality grounds.<\/p>\n<p>Viceroy continue to be contacted by physicians, former employees, former and current VA employees all speaking on a similar theme when explaining MiMedx conduct. We thank these brave individuals for fighting back against the unnecessary, aggressive, and retaliatory actions of MiMedx.<\/p>\n<p>Viceroy were informed by various physicians that they had reported their concerns to the Office of Inspector General U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services .<\/p>\n<p>We are also led to believe that MiMedx\u2019s statement of assisting the Department of Veterans Affairs with its on-going investigation is incomplete, if not deceptive, via omission. Viceroy believe investors should have been told of these investigations and what information was requested by VA investigators.<\/p>\n<p>The more MiMedx management continue to lie to its investors through press releases and responses to short seller articles, the more disillusioned and harassed former employees send Viceroy evidence countering their claims.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>PDF Download Link MiMedx emails to former employees are in clear violation of federal law:&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_links_to":"","_links_to_target":""},"categories":[61],"tags":[],"table_tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v15.6.2 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>MiMedx - Vendors soliciting up-coding of Medicare incentives. | Viceroy Research<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/2017\/11\/16\/mimedx-vendors-soliciting-up-coding-of-medicare-incentives\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"MiMedx - Vendors soliciting up-coding of Medicare incentives. | Viceroy Research\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"PDF Download Link MiMedx emails to former employees are in clear violation of federal law:...\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/2017\/11\/16\/mimedx-vendors-soliciting-up-coding-of-medicare-incentives\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:site_name\" content=\"Viceroy Research\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:published_time\" content=\"2017-11-16T15:16:31+00:00\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:modified_time\" content=\"2020-12-16T14:46:50+00:00\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:card\" content=\"summary_large_image\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:label1\" content=\"Est. reading time\">\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:data1\" content=\"2 minutes\">\n<script type=\"application\/ld+json\" class=\"yoast-schema-graph\">{\"@context\":\"https:\/\/schema.org\",\"@graph\":[{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/#organization\",\"name\":\"Viceroy Research\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/\",\"sameAs\":[],\"logo\":{\"@type\":\"ImageObject\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/#logo\",\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/cropped-VT-Tulip.png\",\"width\":512,\"height\":512,\"caption\":\"Viceroy Research\"},\"image\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/#logo\"}},{\"@type\":\"WebSite\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/#website\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/\",\"name\":\"Viceroy Research\",\"description\":\"A group of individuals that see the world differently.\",\"publisher\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/#organization\"},\"potentialAction\":[{\"@type\":\"SearchAction\",\"target\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/?s={search_term_string}\",\"query-input\":\"required name=search_term_string\"}],\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\"},{\"@type\":\"WebPage\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/2017\/11\/16\/mimedx-vendors-soliciting-up-coding-of-medicare-incentives\/#webpage\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/2017\/11\/16\/mimedx-vendors-soliciting-up-coding-of-medicare-incentives\/\",\"name\":\"MiMedx - Vendors soliciting up-coding of Medicare incentives. | Viceroy Research\",\"isPartOf\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/#website\"},\"datePublished\":\"2017-11-16T15:16:31+00:00\",\"dateModified\":\"2020-12-16T14:46:50+00:00\",\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\",\"potentialAction\":[{\"@type\":\"ReadAction\",\"target\":[\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/2017\/11\/16\/mimedx-vendors-soliciting-up-coding-of-medicare-incentives\/\"]}]},{\"@type\":\"Article\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/2017\/11\/16\/mimedx-vendors-soliciting-up-coding-of-medicare-incentives\/#article\",\"isPartOf\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/2017\/11\/16\/mimedx-vendors-soliciting-up-coding-of-medicare-incentives\/#webpage\"},\"author\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/#\/schema\/person\/38e10fc7394949cc6e1f60bbc3ac77df\"},\"headline\":\"MiMedx &#8211;
