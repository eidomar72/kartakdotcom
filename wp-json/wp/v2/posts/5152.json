This is both fascinating and embarrassing.<\/p>\n<p>Accordingly, Viceroy find it prudent to publish evidence of the interview, which was conducted on 22 June (ET). The whole length of the interview was approximately 35 mins. We have extracted entire segments (without adjustments) of pertinent discussion points.<\/p>\n<p>We note that this interview (and all communications with Ms Shino) were conducted after NAMGOV directed the MME to develop a &#8220;communication strategy to address misinformation&#8221; relating to RECO.

Unconventional Resources and Fracking<\/p>\n<p>Ms Shino unequivocally states that there will never be any fracking on Namibian soil.<\/p>\n<p>Recording #4 &#8211; Stages of Exploration<\/p>\n<p>Ms Shino explains that ReconAfrica&#8217;s exploration is still at a very early stage and therefore unable to confirm if such a project would be commercially viable<\/p>\n<p>Recording #5 &#8211;
