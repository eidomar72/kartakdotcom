Tyro is the 5<sup>th<\/sup> largest merchant acquiring bank (by number of terminals) in Australia, behind the four major banks ($NAB, $CBA, $WBC, $ANZ). Since its IPO in late 2019, Tyro has singled itself out as the most unreliable &amp; technologically inferior fintech in Australia.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Over the last week, our research suggests <strong>Tyro has \u201cbricked\u201d (verb: to turn into a brick) \u00a0~50% of its terminals across the country<\/strong> via a software patch, which requires a recall and capital-intensive terminal repair\/replacement. It has no disaster recovery plan and has left businesses, including medical facilities, without any means to collect payment from customers.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Viceroy Research believes Tyro presents a limited-risk short as customers churn in record numbers to vastly superior, non-archaic payment solutions providers, which are available in abundance, and immediately.<\/strong> Tyro presents no real catalyst to make a jump into profitability.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Despite being in operation since 2003 <strong>Tyro is increasingly loss making and floats its operating cash flows through customer deposits<\/strong> in its banking division.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We believe Tyro presents <strong>significant downside<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The company\u2019s financials are unappealing, and their undifferentiated and outdated product offering is in stark contrast to fresh market participants. <strong>The reputational and financial fallout from this outage will likely be severe and long-lasting<\/strong>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Investors should <strong>demand an independent investigation<\/strong> into the issues surrounding Tyro\u2019s \u201cbricking\u201d of merchant terminals, together with a review of intenal controls.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Edit: We note there was a typo on the date of this blog post.
