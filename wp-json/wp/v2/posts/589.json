(NASDAQ: ATNX). Our research has found significant causes for concern in the company\u2019s operations, management and clinical trial design. Our research, paired with discussions with industry specialists, leads us to believe <strong><u>Oraxol is obsolete in modern world medicine<\/u><\/strong>. We conclude that Athenex exists to abuse capital markets and enrich its management through <strong><u>related party transactions and licensing deals, rather than bring revolutionary drugs into the market<\/u><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Viceroy value ATNX stock at <u>US$2.83 \u2013 a 71%<\/u> <u>downside<\/u><\/strong> \u2013the sum of its tangible book value and 1x valuation on its licensing &amp; consulting revenue streams, for the year ending June 30, 2019. With ATNX\u2019s questionable license acquisitions and management\u2019s precedent for overstated top line figures in previous ventures: this is optimistic.<\/p>\n<h3>Management \u2013 A Company of Rogues<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Several members of <strong>Athenex\u2019s management team have a history of what appears to be either gross incompetence in fiduciary duties or clever mismanagement <\/strong><strong>in <u>infamous frauds<\/u> internationally<\/strong>, collectively resulting in billions of dollars of write-offs including <strong>Sino Forest and Suntech.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>ATNX directors have also acted as sellers and drop-shippers<\/strong> <strong>to rip off Athenex shareholders with margin-stealing exercises through their investment entity: Avalon Global<\/strong>. <strong>Cash has consistently exited the business via similar related party deals. <\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Breaches in corporate governance principles:\u00a0<strong>Athenex directors screwed investors by purchasing CDE for themselves and flipping it to Athenex for a 262% profit in 6 weeks<\/strong>. The company failed to report the circumstances of the transaction in any meaningful way.<\/li>\n<li>In a separate instance, <strong>Directors pocketed a 3,300% profitby flipping an <\/strong><strong>\u201canti-cancer mechanism\u201d<\/strong><strong> license to\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Athenex<\/strong><strong> for US$5m, for which\u00a0<\/strong>they paid just US$150,000 just 6 months earlier.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Directors<\/strong><strong> award themselves millions of dollars\u2019 worth of stock at <u>no<\/u> cost<\/strong> through the issuance of promissory notes that are cancelled on a time-vested basis.<\/li>\n<li>Athenex directorshave an uncanny ability to<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>avoid any disclosure or reference to their involvement in historical fraud or related party deals<\/strong>. It&#8217;s Viceroy&#8217;s view that if investors were aware, they <strong>would not<\/strong> <strong>have bought $ATNX in the first place.\u00a0<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Athenex\u2019s CFO J. Nick Riehle <strong><u>left unexpectedly for a \u201cplanned\u201d retirement<\/u><\/strong><u>,<\/u> just 10 months after joining the company but is now seeking work as a consultant.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Oraxol \u2013 Flagship or Shipwreck?<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Athenex has been reliant on the marketed prospect of Oraxol in order to obtain access to capital<\/strong>, having received going concern qualifications from Deloitte since 2016 and current yearly cash-burn rates of ~$100m. The company has raised ~US$360m in equity and US$80m in debt since 2017. <strong>Even if R&amp;D costs are removed from the equation, Athenex\u2019s licensing and consulting segments are operationally loss-making.<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>After consultation with industry specialists and oncologists, Viceroy believes Athenex\u2019s flagship paclitaxel drug, <strong>Oraxol, cannot compete with the <u>current standard of care<\/u> available in the USA<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Oraxol\u2019s clinical trial\u2019s <strong>control dosing regimen of IV paclitaxel as monotherapy is an <u>outdated treatment schedule dating from the 1990\u2019s. <\/u><\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Oraxol\u2019s marketed quality of life improvements are redundant<\/strong>. Patients will still require IV \/treatment post-treatment, alongside complications from oral treatment.<\/li>\n<li>Oraxol\u2019s side effects appear more severe than those of the current US standard of care, Abraxane, and <strong><u>may require hospitalization due to their life-threatening nature.<\/u><\/strong> Reported adverse effects grade 4 neutropenia, grade 3 vomiting and unspecified GI complications were more severe than IV paclitaxel intake.<\/li>\n<li><strong>None of Oraxol\u2019s clinical trials have included a US patient component.<\/strong> While the FDA does allow data overseas trials, these results are treated with much higher scrutiny. <strong>Viceroy believe ATNX studies are being conducted in South America due to a lower local standard of care<\/strong>: US patients could not be enticed to trial a drug against an outdated active control regimen.<\/li>\n<li>Athenex\u2019s Orascovery program \u2013 key to its marketed value proposition \u2013 was purchased for just US$7.5m upfront in 2011 after its previous owner experienced <strong>decade-long development delays with little headway into development. The Orascovery platform is busted<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Through consultation with experts, we believe Athenex\u2019s pursuit of the 505b(2) pathway for Oraxol will be hampered by the fact that its paclitaxel delivery mechanism, <strong>HM30181A, has never been approved by the FDA<\/strong>. The <strong>FDA may require Athenex to pursue a further NDA for HM30181A<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Viceroy have identified what we believe to be <strong>Intellectual Property Theft from UK company Immunocore. <\/strong>XLifeSc\u2019s flagship technology (in which ATNX put $35m upfront) <strong>may already be owned by GSK and further along the development pipeline:<\/strong> GSK\u2019s solution is currently undergoing phase 2 trials in the US.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Athenex\u2019s operational and R&amp;D cash-burn rate is over US$100m a year \u2013 the company would be lucky to survive until HY 2020 without needing a further cash injection from investors. Even if Athenex scrapped its R&amp;D completely, the company\u2019s revenue streams operate at a substantial loss.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Accordingly, we believe our valuation of $2.83 is optimistic, and will be realized in the short term. We do not see a future for the company in its current state. <\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Poorly designed clinical study for flagship drug outdated since 2005.
