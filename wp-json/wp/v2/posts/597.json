Management\u2019s response underestimates how many improprieties are recorded in the public domain \u2013 we have yet to scratch the tip of the iceberg.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The company\u2019s response to Viceroy\u2019s research is a further slap in the face to investors:<strong> <u>the company has failed to address a single issue highlighted in any of our reports<\/u><\/strong>.\n<ul>\n<li><u>Athenex\u2019s <strong>two-paragraph rebuttal to Viceroy\u2019s reports indicates management refuse to address any improprieties we have uncovered<\/strong><\/u>\u2026to date. We believe Athenex will have a tough time explaining to shareholders why their <strong>flagship drug is commercially unviable, justifying abusive related party transactions, and explaining why facility pictures are blatantly photoshopped<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong><u>Athenex\u2019s rebuttal state that management \u201ctake pride\u201d in its integrity. This is hilarious given management\u2019s track record of overseeing blatant frauds. <\/u><\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>In case Sino Forest and Suntech weren\u2019t enough, Viceroy now reveals <u>direct<\/u> ties between Athenex directors and more established frauds, responsible for evaporating billions of dollars of shareholder capital: <u>GCL Poly\/Silicon, China Lumena<\/u><\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Several <strong>individuals involved with Zhang\u2019s previous shady ventures are now embedded in the Athenex organization<\/strong> including the Audit committee.\n<ul>\n<li>Viceroy reveal <strong>Athenex Audit Committee member, John Koh, was also a director of Mandra, alongside Songyi Zhang, with direct fiduciary obligation to oversee Sino Forest.<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Zhang was previously a director of China Lumena<\/strong>, which was found to have significantly <strong>fabricated its revenues<\/strong>. In addition to this<strong><u>, a subsidiary that had fabricated ~90% of its revenues was sold to China Lumena by Zhang through several of his investment vehicles<\/u><\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Zhang was also previously at GCL Silicon <\/strong>where he effectively front-ran an acquisition of that company by GCL-Poly Energy in concert with Zuo Gongshan, the CEO of the latter. <strong><u>This netted Zhang a share in US$200m cash, US$350m in secured notes and a 5% stake in GCL-Poly.<\/u><\/strong><\/li>\n<li>SinoPhyto solutions, the side-hustle of Athenex Chief Medical Officer Rudolf Min-Fun Kwan and CEO\/Chairman Johnson Lau purports to be a seller of traditional Chinese medicines. However, the company\u2019s New Jersey certificate indicates it is an investment company. SinoPhyto has only received one shipment.
