During the call, analysts asked pertinent questions that remain substantially unanswered. To assist investors, we\u2019ve compiled a list of items that were conveniently <strong>ignored, avoided<\/strong> or even <strong>blatantly<\/strong> misrepresented.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"download-pdf-cta\" href=\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/final-part-2-pdf.pdf\">PDF Report Download<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Over the last week, MiMedx has:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dismissed \u201cDeceptive Short Seller Reports\u201d, including Viceroy\u2019s, which presented evidence in the form of a withheld FOIA request <strong>suggesting that MiMedx was the subject of an undisclosed SEC enforcement investigation<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Announced that MiMedx are complying with an SEC subpoena, thus subject to an SEC investigation.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Failed to formally announce to the market that they are a subject of an SEC investigation<strong>. Viceroy requested management confirm whether it will fulfill their regulatory requirements by filing an 8-K in relation to an ongoing SEC investigation within the four days<\/strong> of becoming aware of it. If they have not filed an 8-K within 4 days of becoming aware of an SEC investigation, they are in breach of withholding material information from the investing public.<\/li>\n<li>Been announced as the subject of an investigation by two securities litigation firms: Block &amp; Leviton and Bragar Eagel &amp; Squire, P.C. Both firms announced it had <strong>commenced investigations into a class action on behalf of MiMedx shareholders<\/strong> on September 22 and 25, 2017 respectively for not disclosing they were under SEC investigation, amongst other things.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Backdated government FAR &amp; DFARS certification records<\/strong> as far as <strong>2013<\/strong> which were previously filled out by an employee, Don Ayers \u2013 who no longer worked at MiMedx at the time of certification \u2013 with Kimberley Durgan \u2013 who only commenced employment with MiMedx in <strong>2014.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Backdated FAR &amp; DFARs certifications<\/strong> remained signed with the authority of VP Brent Miller, whose LinkedIn status as of May 2017 is \u2018Officially Retired\u2019, and thus had no authority within MiMedx at the time of the amendments.<\/li>\n<li>Announced it had come to a settlement of a confidential lawsuit with terminated employee Hal Purdy, <strong>a move we believe serves only to distract from the issues raised in our report <\/strong>which as yet go unacknowledged and undiscussed by the company.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>MiMedx cherry-picked a handful of bulls for the September 21 call last week, restricting access&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_links_to":"","_links_to_target":""},"categories":[61],"tags":[],"table_tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v15.6.2 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>MiMedx - Part 2 - The same old story;
