Petit, and the appointment of Mr. David Coles, a Managing Director of Alvarez &amp; Marsal, as the company\u2019s interim CEO.<\/p>\n<p>The appointment of Mr. Coles follows MiMedx\u2019s engagement of KPMG and King &amp; Spalding, who we understand have been tasked with, among other things, conducting an independent internal investigation into MiMedx sales practices .<\/p>\n<p>Viceroy understands that a key element of these internal investigations concerns MiMedx\u2019s conduct with the United States Department of Veteran\u2019s Affairs (DVA); specifically, the allegations of channel stuffing and the subsequent indictment of DVA physicians utilizing MiMedx products. These physicians are in the process of cooperating with the US Attorney General\u2019s case in relation to the charges alleged in the criminal filings including receiving bribes and inducements, and over-use of MiMedx product within the VA.<\/p>\n<p>Viceroy Research has been made aware of links between other Alvarez &amp; Marsal and a cohort of individuals allegedly exercising undue influence over the DVA, colloquially referred to as the \u201cMar-a-Lago Crowd\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Given the depth of investigations occurring at MiMedx relating to the company\u2019s conduct with the DVA, Viceroy believe the appointment of Alvarez &amp; Marsal represents an irremediable conflict of interest to MiMedx\u2019s ongoing internal investigations, and to the investigations we understand are ongoing within the DVA and other federal regulatory entities.<\/p>\n<p>We have addressed a separate letter to the Department of Justice and the DVA\u2019s ethics committee outlining what we believe is a serious conflict of interest and undue influence within the DVA of several parties.Further, we believe that it is irresponsible that this group, when exposed by journalists, was saved from a congressional hearing by longtime friend of former MiMedx CEO Petit, Senator Jonny Isakson, who has benefited greatly from donations from MiMedx and Petit.<\/p>\n<p>Enclosed is a brief report detailing our investigation into this matter. A more comprehensive report will be published post VA OIG approval. The PCAOB and Investigators has stated that \u201cWhen an auditor is confronted with multiple indicators of problematic revenue recognition \u2026 he or she must get to the bottom of the relevant issues, including digging into management\u2019s representations.\u201d We stand ready to assist in this effort and sincerely appreciate your attention to this extremely important matter.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>OCTOBER 15, 2018 &#8211; Request for investigation into perceived\/potential conflict of interest.
