In other news, CEO Robin Raina claims Ebix has never \u201cbeen on the wrong side of any regulatory or tax authority\u201d.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"download-pdf-cta\" title=\"Ebix - The Taxman Cometh 2018.12.13\" href=\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/Ebix-The-Taxman-Cometh-2018.12.13.pdf\">The Taxman Cometh &#8211; Report Download Link<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Viceroy released its preliminary report on Ebix \u2013 titled Goodwill Hunting \u2013 on 11 December 2017, the contents of which we also discussed at the Kase Learning conference in New York on December 3, 2018.<\/p>\n<p>This report will address the totally inadequate response Ebix issued on December 12, 2018, which was substantially an attempt at authority bias by CEO Robin Raina. Accordingly, we will also shine a light on the statements Raina decided to include in this press release, which we believe to be extremely misleading.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ebix acknowledged our report via a press release on December 12, 2018, however CEO Raina would rather issue a hollow press release than address the issues Viceroy have raised in our preceding report.<\/li>\n<li>Robin Raina claims Ebix has \u201cnever been on the wrong side of any regulatory or tax authority\u201d. This is inconsistent with:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ebix\u2019s Mumbai office being subject to an undisclosed \u201csearch\u201d by Indian Tax Authorities for suspicion of tax evasion in late August 2018;<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Ebix currently subject to <strong>a tax audit by the Australian Taxation<\/strong> office since <strong>at least 2016;<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Ebix historically settling an <strong>IRS dispute for &gt;$20m;<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Ebix being subjected to a prolonged SEC investigation;<\/li>\n<li>Ebix being subject to a <strong>possible ongoing DOJ investigation;<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Contrary to Raina\u2019s claims, it appears his conduct was subject to regulatory scrutiny even prior to his rise to CEO. Ebix\u2019s former auditor, Arthur Anderson, was charged by the SEC for improper conduct and fraud relating to the audit of Ebix\u2019s revenue recognition practices at a time where Raina was VP of Sales and Marketing and COO.<\/li>\n<li>Robin Raina claims Ebix has had \u201cno differences with any statutory or consolidated auditors across the world in the last two decades&#8221;. This is <strong>objectively, and verifiably false, as we have already reported.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Ebix detracts attention to concerns raised through reinforcement of its commitment to stock buybacks, of which it has announced US$330m since 2015 and only fulfilled US$187.169m.<\/li>\n<li>Viceroy is writing to the relevant debt providers shortly with these and other material concerns.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Viceroy\u2019s original report can be found here:<\/p>\n<p><a
