Our investigation has uncovered <strong>accounting discrepancies dating as far back as 2008<\/strong> <strong>to present day <\/strong>as well as several other red flags.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"download-pdf-cta\" title=\"Ebix 12.11.2018\" href=\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/ebix-12-11-2018.pdf\">Report Download Link<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a class=\"download-pdf-cta\" title=\"Filings\" href=\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/filings.zip\">Filings.zip &#8211; Download Link<\/a><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Numerous accounting discrepancies in years 2013 to 2018<\/strong> regarding the recognition of goodwill and acquisitions within the Ebix group. These discrepancies have largely gone unnoticed due to the delay in local filings being signed off and the multi-jurisdictional nature of these transactions.<\/li>\n<li>Over the course of our investigation <strong>we uncovered evidence of what we believe is a scheme to incorrectly book revenue and earnings.<\/strong> We believe this is done through the shuffling of assets from one subsidiary to another while improperly booking internal revenues, and contingent consideration <strong>\u201ccookie jar\u201d<\/strong><strong> accounting<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>We are limited by the recency of the available subsidiary filings. We believe this behavior continues to take place. Ebix\u2019s acquisition spree in India further muddies the waters.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Ebix announced a change in auditor to T.R. Chadha from Cherry Bekaert (of MiMedx fame)<\/strong> after reporting <strong>material weaknesses regarding purchase and income tax accounting<\/strong>, pursuant to appointing a big four accounting firm in Q1 2019.<\/li>\n<li>T.R. Chadha has never audited a US-listed entity and was auditor of several Indian Ebix subsidiaries in which there appear to be several accounting discrepancies.<\/li>\n<li>Cherry Bekaert was subject to a scathing PCAOB inspection just weeks before its replacement.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Ebix\u2019s subsidiary structure is excessively convoluted and opaque<\/strong>. The subsidiary structure includes holding companies in geographies where obtaining financials is near impossible. Many subsidiaries are held under a UK entity, Ebix International Holdings, which has only ever filed locally as a dormant company and <strong>recently received a warning of compulsory dissolution for failing to file accounts.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Ebix\u2019s joint venture with Vayam Technologies, Ebix Vayam, <strong>accounts for 25% of Ebix\u2019s receivables<\/strong> and only customers are Vayam Technologies themselves. <strong>Vayam appears never to have settled its receivables and the entire JV is funded by Ebix at an 8% interest rate<\/strong>, payable in receivables. This appears to be a scheme through which cash is injected in to make paper gains of margin plus 8%.<\/li>\n<li>Ebix CEO <strong>Robin Raina is entitled to a massive payout in the event of an acquisition at the expense of shareholders. <\/strong>This poison pill protects short-sellers from takeovers by attaching an unreasonable premium to the company. This arrangement and its predecessor are currently subject of ongoing shareholder litigation.<\/li>\n<li>The company\u2019s <b>debt-fueled\u00a0acquisition binge in India was originally intended to create and list an Indian payments entity<\/b>. This appears to have turned into an unfocused roll-up, with more and more scattered businesses being added to the Ebix stable. Despite these additions, Ebix does not break out its revenues from these disparate income streams.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Ebix\u2019s has been subject to an undisclosed tax audit by the Australian Taxation Office since 2016<\/strong>, we believe due to the transfer of Telstra eBusiness Exchange assets to Ebix Singapore, and non-arm\u2019s length transactions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Due to the delay in availability of subsidiary accounts, and the rapidly expanding nature of the company\u2019s operations we are unable to quantify a base downside. We believe it is highly likely given the progress of the shareholder litigation that regulatory authorities including the SEC open or reopen their investigations into the company. Accordingly, <strong>we believe that Ebix carries a high investment risk<\/strong>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Accounting irregularities, undisclosed tax investigations, auditor shuffling, poison pill to protect short sellers: welcome to&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_links_to":"","_links_to_target":""},"categories":[79],"tags":[],"table_tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v15.6.2 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Ebix - Goodwill Hunting | Viceroy Research<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/2018\/12\/11\/ebix-goodwill-hunting-2\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Ebix - Goodwill Hunting | Viceroy Research\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"Accounting irregularities, undisclosed tax investigations, auditor shuffling, poison pill to protect short sellers: welcome to...\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/2018\/12\/11\/ebix-goodwill-hunting-2\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:site_name\" content=\"Viceroy Research\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:published_time\" content=\"2018-12-11T14:51:22+00:00\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:modified_time\" content=\"2020-12-16T14:39:46+00:00\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:card\" content=\"summary_large_image\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:label1\" content=\"Est. reading time\">\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:data1\" content=\"3 minutes\">\n<script type=\"application\/ld+json\" class=\"yoast-schema-graph\">{\"@context\":\"https:\/\/schema.org\",\"@graph\":[{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/#organization\",\"name\":\"Viceroy Research\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/\",\"sameAs\":[],\"logo\":{\"@type\":\"ImageObject\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/#logo\",\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/cropped-VT-Tulip.png\",\"width\":512,\"height\":512,\"caption\":\"Viceroy Research\"},\"image\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/#logo\"}},{\"@type\":\"WebSite\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/#website\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/\",\"name\":\"Viceroy Research\",\"description\":\"A group of individuals that see the world differently.\",\"publisher\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/#organization\"},\"potentialAction\":[{\"@type\":\"SearchAction\",\"target\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/?s={search_term_string}\",\"query-input\":\"required name=search_term_string\"}],\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\"},{\"@type\":\"WebPage\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/2018\/12\/11\/ebix-goodwill-hunting-2\/#webpage\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/2018\/12\/11\/ebix-goodwill-hunting-2\/\",\"name\":\"Ebix - Goodwill Hunting | Viceroy Research\",\"isPartOf\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/#website\"},\"datePublished\":\"2018-12-11T14:51:22+00:00\",\"dateModified\":\"2020-12-16T14:39:46+00:00\",\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\",\"potentialAction\":[{\"@type\":\"ReadAction\",\"target\":[\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/2018\/12\/11\/ebix-goodwill-hunting-2\/\"]}]},{\"@type\":\"Article\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/2018\/12\/11\/ebix-goodwill-hunting-2\/#article\",\"isPartOf\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/2018\/12\/11\/ebix-goodwill-hunting-2\/#webpage\"},\"author\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/#\/schema\/person\/38e10fc7394949cc6e1f60bbc3ac77df\"},\"headline\":\"Ebix &#8211;
