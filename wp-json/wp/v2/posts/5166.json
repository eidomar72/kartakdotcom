The video is available at the link below.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fb.watch\/6Je7e1d6eR\/\">https:\/\/fb.watch\/6Je7e1d6eR\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>In the interview Arkert states:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>ReconAfrica&#8217;s plan since inception was based on fracking tight shales in the Kavango basin. Their recent backpedalling to reclassify this as a conventional oil play is purely cosmetic.<\/li>\n<li>The company&#8217;s promotion of a working hydrocarbon system is wishful thinking designed to maintain hype around the stock and &#8220;not based on any scientific principle whatsoever&#8221;.<\/li>\n<li>ReconAfrica&#8217;s exploration method is a marked deviation from established exploration principles by drilling wildcat holes without seismic data and based on a model rife with assumptions. Mr. Arkert also referred to gravity data showing ReconAfrica drilling an area with &#8220;very limited potential&#8221;.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Mr. Arkert challenged ReconAfrica CEO Scott Evans to a public debate chaired by an independent Namibian organization. Viceroy fully support this debate to clarify the ongoing issues we have found with ReconAfrica and its operations.<\/p>\n<p>Further, Mr Arkert\u2019s interview substantially agrees with data presented to Good Morning Africa on 12 July 2021, in an interview with Viceroy Research\u2019s Gabriel Bernarde:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fb.watch\/6Jejilrly_\/\">https:\/\/fb.watch\/6Jejilrly_\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE:<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>July 19, 2021 &#8211;\u00a0<\/strong>Another expert geologist has come forward with serious concerns about ReconAfrica&#8217;s operations. Matt Totten Jnr. appeared on Africa Good Morning on July 16, 2021 to share his concerns with the company&#8217;s reckless and unorthodox conduct. Totten has significant experience with unconventional reservoirs and previously worked with BP as an exploration and operations geologist.<\/p>\n<p>The video is available at the link below:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/112444947285636\/posts\/308698157660313\/\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/112444947285636\/posts\/308698157660313\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>In the interview Mr. Totten reiterated several points made by Mr. Arkert as well as further issues about the comapny&#8217;;s conduct stating:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>ReconAfrica&#8217;s have presented no verifiable information to back up the geological model underpinning the venture.<\/li>\n<li>That the company has no reason to withhold important information such as well depth from investors because it owns the entirety of the lease position.<\/li>\n<li>Reiterated that ReconAfrica have promoted the play as an unconventional shale play requiring &#8220;thousands and thousands&#8221; of wells to produce resulting in far-reaching and permanent environmental issues. The company has not categorically ruled out fracking, even though it is forbidden under Namibian law.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Mr. Totten is part of a growing number of expert voices both in Namibia and overseas who are concerned about, and opposed to, ReconAfrica&#8217;s conduct. Such widespread condemnation amongst independent experts both regarding the company&#8217;s conduct and its consequences further reinforces Viceroy&#8217;s view that the company is operating against established norms and promoting their operations without substance.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>July 13, 2021 &#8211;\u00a0This morning on Africa Good Morning geologist and environmental expert Jan Arkert&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_links_to":"","_links_to_target":""},"categories":[110],"tags":[],"table_tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v15.6.2 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>ReconAfrica - Africa Good Morning Interview with geologist Jan Arkert | Viceroy Research<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/2021\/07\/13\/reconafrica-africa-good-morning-interview-with-geologist-jan-arkert\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"ReconAfrica - Africa Good Morning Interview with geologist Jan Arkert | Viceroy Research\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"July 13, 2021 &#8211;\u00a0This morning on Africa Good Morning geologist and environmental expert Jan Arkert...\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/2021\/07\/13\/reconafrica-africa-good-morning-interview-with-geologist-jan-arkert\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:site_name\" content=\"Viceroy Research\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:published_time\" content=\"2021-07-13T13:46:10+00:00\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:modified_time\" content=\"2021-07-19T14:47:47+00:00\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:card\" content=\"summary_large_image\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:label1\" content=\"Est. reading time\">\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:data1\" content=\"2 minutes\">\n<script type=\"application\/ld+json\" class=\"yoast-schema-graph\">{\"@context\":\"https:\/\/schema.org\",\"@graph\":[{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/#organization\",\"name\":\"Viceroy Research\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/\",\"sameAs\":[],\"logo\":{\"@type\":\"ImageObject\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/#logo\",\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/cropped-VT-Tulip.png\",\"width\":512,\"height\":512,\"caption\":\"Viceroy Research\"},\"image\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/#logo\"}},{\"@type\":\"WebSite\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/#website\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/\",\"name\":\"Viceroy Research\",\"description\":\"A group of individuals that see the world differently.\",\"publisher\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/#organization\"},\"potentialAction\":[{\"@type\":\"SearchAction\",\"target\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/?s={search_term_string}\",\"query-input\":\"required name=search_term_string\"}],\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\"},{\"@type\":\"WebPage\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/2021\/07\/13\/reconafrica-africa-good-morning-interview-with-geologist-jan-arkert\/#webpage\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/2021\/07\/13\/reconafrica-africa-good-morning-interview-with-geologist-jan-arkert\/\",\"name\":\"ReconAfrica - Africa Good Morning Interview with geologist Jan Arkert | Viceroy Research\",\"isPartOf\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/#website\"},\"datePublished\":\"2021-07-13T13:46:10+00:00\",\"dateModified\":\"2021-07-19T14:47:47+00:00\",\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\",\"potentialAction\":[{\"@type\":\"ReadAction\",\"target\":[\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/2021\/07\/13\/reconafrica-africa-good-morning-interview-with-geologist-jan-arkert\/\"]}]},{\"@type\":\"Article\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/2021\/07\/13\/reconafrica-africa-good-morning-interview-with-geologist-jan-arkert\/#article\",\"isPartOf\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/2021\/07\/13\/reconafrica-africa-good-morning-interview-with-geologist-jan-arkert\/#webpage\"},\"author\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/#\/schema\/person\/38e10fc7394949cc6e1f60bbc3ac77df\"},\"headline\":\"ReconAfrica &#8211;
