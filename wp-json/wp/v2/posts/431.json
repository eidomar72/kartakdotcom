Where we have conducted calculations, our analysis and workings have been show in full. Investors have the ability to determine the veracity of our analysis and conduct their own due diligence.<\/p>\n<p>We are not of the opinion that NEPI has consistently proven transparency towards shareholders, the latest example of which is the outright refusal to engage an independent party to investigate potential trading of associated companies, suspicious capital raising activity and property transactions, at the request of 10 of South Africa\u2019s largest financial institutions (including Government fund managers).<\/p>\n<p>In stark contrast to any \u201creasons\u201d NEPI provides for accounting discrepancies, investors should also note with extreme caution that the Company failed to provide details of outgoings, arrears, management matters, negotiations, rent reviews, to its valuers, Cushman &amp; Wakefield. This was not an issue for all its other geographies.<\/p>\n<p>Further to this, analysis of NEPI\u2019s Romanian portfolio accounts show the company has, on average, 80 days of accounts receivable. This is indicative of substantial rent arrears, and fails the company\u2019s claim of a 99.9% collection rate. These issues are independent of where earnings have been recognized, if this should indeed be NEPI\u2019s response, and would not account for discrepancies in taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions.<\/p>\n<p>We look forward to NEPI\u2019s comprehensive response to our report.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>November 28, 2018 \u2013 Viceroy published its report on NEPI Rockcastle on November 28, 2018&#8230;.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_links_to":"","_links_to_target":""},"categories":[78],"tags":[],"table_tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v15.6.2 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>NEPI Rockcastle - Response to statement by NEPI Rockcastle | Viceroy Research<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/2018\/11\/28\/response-to-statement-by-nepi-rockcastle\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"NEPI Rockcastle - Response to statement by NEPI Rockcastle | Viceroy Research\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"November 28, 2018 \u2013 Viceroy published its report on NEPI Rockcastle on November 28, 2018....\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/2018\/11\/28\/response-to-statement-by-nepi-rockcastle\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:site_name\" content=\"Viceroy Research\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:published_time\" content=\"2018-11-28T13:57:27+00:00\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:modified_time\" content=\"2020-12-16T14:40:25+00:00\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:card\" content=\"summary_large_image\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:label1\" content=\"Est. reading time\">\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:data1\" content=\"1 minute\">\n<script type=\"application\/ld+json\" class=\"yoast-schema-graph\">{\"@context\":\"https:\/\/schema.org\",\"@graph\":[{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/#organization\",\"name\":\"Viceroy Research\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/\",\"sameAs\":[],\"logo\":{\"@type\":\"ImageObject\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/#logo\",\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/cropped-VT-Tulip.png\",\"width\":512,\"height\":512,\"caption\":\"Viceroy Research\"},\"image\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/#logo\"}},{\"@type\":\"WebSite\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/#website\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/\",\"name\":\"Viceroy Research\",\"description\":\"A group of individuals that see the world differently.\",\"publisher\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/#organization\"},\"potentialAction\":[{\"@type\":\"SearchAction\",\"target\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/?s={search_term_string}\",\"query-input\":\"required name=search_term_string\"}],\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\"},{\"@type\":\"WebPage\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/2018\/11\/28\/response-to-statement-by-nepi-rockcastle\/#webpage\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/2018\/11\/28\/response-to-statement-by-nepi-rockcastle\/\",\"name\":\"NEPI Rockcastle - Response to statement by NEPI Rockcastle | Viceroy Research\",\"isPartOf\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/#website\"},\"datePublished\":\"2018-11-28T13:57:27+00:00\",\"dateModified\":\"2020-12-16T14:40:25+00:00\",\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\",\"potentialAction\":[{\"@type\":\"ReadAction\",\"target\":[\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/2018\/11\/28\/response-to-statement-by-nepi-rockcastle\/\"]}]},{\"@type\":\"Article\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/2018\/11\/28\/response-to-statement-by-nepi-rockcastle\/#article\",\"isPartOf\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/2018\/11\/28\/response-to-statement-by-nepi-rockcastle\/#webpage\"},\"author\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/#\/schema\/person\/38e10fc7394949cc6e1f60bbc3ac77df\"},\"headline\":\"NEPI Rockcastle &#8211;
