The documents clearly outline MiMedx\u2019s fraudulent sales methods including misrepresenting reimbursement rates for products and \u201c<strong>marketing the spread<\/strong>\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>This report details the serious misconduct and underhanded sales tactics of MiMedx personnel in California, which executive management were certainly aware of given the ensuing litigation. As we have demonstrated over 20+ reports, these types of improprieties are commonplace throughout the organization. Never before have our legal advisers or consultants come across such gross and serious misconduct.<\/p>\n<p>The Mad River documents also show MiMedx engaged in \u201cselling on reimbursement\u201d, contrary to a several laws and regulations and some alleged MiMedx policies.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>MiMedx sued Mad River for non-payment of invoices for EpiFix and AmnioFix products. <strong><em>Unfortunately for MiMedx this is where the story becomes compelling for law enforcement and regulators<\/em><\/strong><em>.<\/em><\/li>\n<li><strong>MiMedx misrepresented to Mad River the reimbursement rates for its EpiFix and AmnioFix products, as well as misrepresenting insurer\u2019s attitudes towards these products<\/strong>. Several insurers considered MiMedx products \u201cexperimental and un-reimbursable\u201d.<\/li>\n<li>Following Mad River\u2019s failure to pay, MiMedx sent \u201creimbursement\u201d specialists to Mad River who upheld that MiMedx\u2019s represented reimbursement rates were correct. Mad River believes that this <strong>was simply a manner of continuing the ruse while raising further invoices.<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The Mad River filings portray (we believe accurately) MiMedx as third-rate con-artists.<\/p>\n<p>Contrary to Parker H. Petite\u2019s rhetoric of \u201cGood Business Acumen\u201d and persistent denials of \u201cmarketing the spread\u201d, this report will <strong>unlawful practices that MiMedx, including \u201cmarketing the spread\u201d<\/strong>. This is the very tip of the iceberg that law enforcement and regulators have been made aware of.<\/p>\n<p>It is Viceroy\u2019s intention to continue the dialogue with MiMedx\u2019s auditors and regulators to bring about the prosecution of Parker H. Petit.<\/p>\n<p><strong>In the wake of mounting evidence of fraud, illegal revenue recognition systems, retaliation against whistleblowers and concealing evidence from investors, we immediately call for Parker H.
