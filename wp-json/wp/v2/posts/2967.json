Namely against employees which have breached their non-compete with the company. Viceroy has previously published on MiMedx detailing its dubious hiring practices, connections to related party employee owned distributors, improper government filings and undisclosed SEC investigation.<\/p>\n<p>Many former MiMedx employees <strong><u>that are not in legal conflict with MiMedx have reached out to Viceroy<\/u><\/strong> to provide information and corroboration of our investigations. All whistleblowers are extremely fearful of <strong><em>physical<\/em><\/strong> <strong><em>and legal<\/em><\/strong> retribution from MiMedx. They have provided images, statements, corroborating phone data\/records and further information about the company\u2019s channel stuffing practices, executive impropriety and lack of disclosure.<\/p>\n<p>Contrary to their statements, we believe <strong>MiMedx intentionally turns a blind eye to certain employees setting up their own distributorships especially where it is likely to benefit MiMedx revenue schemes<\/strong>. This has been confirmed by former employees who told Viceroy:<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u201c\u2026some people are allowed to break a rule [that] others are not.
