We believe Capitec\u2019s concealed problems largely resemble those seen at African Bank Investments (JSE: AXL) prior to its collapse in 2014.<\/p>\n<p>We think that it\u2019s only a matter of time before Capitec\u2019s financials and business unravel, with macro headwinds creating an exponential risk of default and bankruptcy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>This report will provide underlying information and analysis we believe supports the following conclusions:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reconciliation of loan book values, maturity profiles and cash outflows imply <strong>Capitec is either fabricating new loans and collections, or re-financing ~ZAR 2.5bn \u2013 3bn (US$200m-$240m) in <em>principal<\/em> per year by issuing new loans to defaulting clients.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Legal documents obtained by Viceroy <strong>show Capitec advising and approving loans to delinquent customers in order to repay existing loans<\/strong>. These documents also show Capitec engaging in reckless lending practices as defined by South Africa\u2019s National Credit Act. This corroborates Viceroy\u2019s loan book analysis.<\/li>\n<li>As a consequence of re-financing delinquent loans, Viceroy believes Capitec\u2019s loan book is massively overstated. <strong>Viceroy\u2019s analysis against competitors suggests an impairment\/write-off impact of ZAR 11bn will more accurately represent the delinquencies and risk in Capitec\u2019s portfolio.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Legal experts that we have spoken to believe that the outcome of an <strong>upcoming<\/strong> <strong>reckless and predatory lending test case in March 2018 will be used to trigger a multi-party litigation refund (class action)<\/strong>. We believe that, at a minimum, Capitec will be required to refund predatory origination fees primarily related to multi-loan facilities; an <strong>estimated ZAR 12.7bn<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Viceroy\u2019s investigations suggest that <strong>Capitec\u2019s prohibited and discontinued multi-loan facility lives on<\/strong>, rebranded as a \u201cCredit Facility\u201d. Former Capitec employees have corroborated this. Despite its perception as an affordable lender, Capitec\u2019s implied interest rates are significantly true of the maximum allowable rates in South Africa.<\/li>\n<li>South Africa\u2019s microfinancing sector has been the graveyard of numerous Capitec competitors who chased the same meteoric growth Capitec displays, largely due to low acceptance criteria and mass delinquencies. <strong>We see no operational difference between Capitec and its ill-fated predecessors, including African Bank.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Former employees consider the business to still be an outright loan-shark operation<\/strong>, where fees are key. Some former employees believe they <strong>were fired for not deceiving borrowers and failing to meet rescheduling targets on impaired\/defaulting loans.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Jean Pierre Verster<\/strong>, <strong>chairman of Capitec\u2019s audit committee<\/strong>, is\/was indirectly short Capitec through Steinhoff. We believe this is an oversight, and understand Verster to be an excellent analyst on the short side. <strong>We encourage Verster to raise the concerns within this report to company auditors and recognize Capitec\u2019s resemblance to his previous African Bank short.<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Given what we believe is a massive overstatement of financial assets and income, together with opaque reporting of loan cash flow and reckless lending practices, <strong>we believe Capitec is simply uninvestable and accordingly have not assigned a target price.<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>PDF Download Link Based on our research and due diligence, we believe that Capitec is&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_links_to":"","_links_to_target":""},"categories":[74],"tags":[],"table_tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v15.6.2 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Capitec - A wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing | Viceroy Research<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/2018\/01\/30\/capitec-a-wolf-in-sheeps-clothing\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Capitec - A wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing | Viceroy Research\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"PDF Download Link Based on our research and due diligence, we believe that Capitec is...\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/2018\/01\/30\/capitec-a-wolf-in-sheeps-clothing\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:site_name\" content=\"Viceroy Research\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:published_time\" content=\"2018-01-30T07:44:25+00:00\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:modified_time\" content=\"2020-12-16T14:44:10+00:00\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:card\" content=\"summary_large_image\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:label1\" content=\"Est. reading time\">\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:data1\" content=\"3 minutes\">\n<script type=\"application\/ld+json\" class=\"yoast-schema-graph\">{\"@context\":\"https:\/\/schema.org\",\"@graph\":[{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/#organization\",\"name\":\"Viceroy Research\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/\",\"sameAs\":[],\"logo\":{\"@type\":\"ImageObject\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/#logo\",\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/cropped-VT-Tulip.png\",\"width\":512,\"height\":512,\"caption\":\"Viceroy Research\"},\"image\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/#logo\"}},{\"@type\":\"WebSite\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/#website\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/\",\"name\":\"Viceroy Research\",\"description\":\"A group of individuals that see the world differently.\",\"publisher\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/#organization\"},\"potentialAction\":[{\"@type\":\"SearchAction\",\"target\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/?s={search_term_string}\",\"query-input\":\"required name=search_term_string\"}],\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\"},{\"@type\":\"WebPage\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/2018\/01\/30\/capitec-a-wolf-in-sheeps-clothing\/#webpage\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/2018\/01\/30\/capitec-a-wolf-in-sheeps-clothing\/\",\"name\":\"Capitec - A wolf in sheep\\u2019s clothing | Viceroy Research\",\"isPartOf\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/#website\"},\"datePublished\":\"2018-01-30T07:44:25+00:00\",\"dateModified\":\"2020-12-16T14:44:10+00:00\",\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\",\"potentialAction\":[{\"@type\":\"ReadAction\",\"target\":[\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/2018\/01\/30\/capitec-a-wolf-in-sheeps-clothing\/\"]}]},{\"@type\":\"Article\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/2018\/01\/30\/capitec-a-wolf-in-sheeps-clothing\/#article\",\"isPartOf\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/2018\/01\/30\/capitec-a-wolf-in-sheeps-clothing\/#webpage\"},\"author\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/#\/schema\/person\/38e10fc7394949cc6e1f60bbc3ac77df\"},\"headline\":\"Capitec &#8211;
