Viceroy\u2019s investigation of Home REIT\u2019s investments and tenants suggests significant downside.<\/p>\n<p>Poor operating results are already reflected in Home REIT\u2019s financials, however management incentives are not aligned with \u201cfixing\u201d these problems, but only rolling up more bad assets.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Several of Home\u2019s largest tenants, including Dovecot and Princess Drive <strong>do not appear to be paying any rent.<\/strong> Financial accounts show zero outflow, and charity activities do not appear to include social housing.<\/li>\n<li>Publicly available charity financials show that <strong>many of these charities may not have the ability to service these leases on a long-term basis (Home REIT purported ~25 years)<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Despite claims to limit exposure per client to 15%: <strong>Home REIT\u2019s largest clients all appear to share the same office and are run by the same people.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Home REIT\u2019s accounts receivables are sitting at 70+ days as at HY 2022, with no impairments recorded. A review of various tenant leases lodged with HM Land Registry show payment terms are consistently 30 days.<\/li>\n<li>Home REIT <em>also<\/em> claims to adopt a straight-line revenue model where substantial portions of rent are collected in the back-end of the 25-year lease terms.<\/li>\n<li>Given our review of Home REIT\u2019s tenants, we do not believe these amounts are collectable.<\/li>\n<li>Viceroy Research has pulled transaction records for every single Home REIT investment property. Some appear to have been flipped between tenants in a short space for immense profits and no evidence of capex.<\/li>\n<li>Government records show many Home REIT properties were acquired at an inflated price thereby artificially inflating its NAV. Other property portfolios display unreasonable appreciation over a short period of time.<\/li>\n<li>Home REIT outsources management to <strong>Alvarium<\/strong>, who is compensated on a percentage of NAV and is responsible for asset acquisitions.<\/li>\n<li>This model does not align Alvarium\u2019s compensation with the performance of the portfolio, only with how much they spend and creates substantial audit risk in the revaluation of Home REIT\u2019s book, and encourages risk-taking behaviors such as leverage.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Home REIT\u2019s tenants raise questions about the financial viability of Home REIT\u2019s portfolio, and also about the appropriateness of this venture. We strongly believe that these are not the people who should be entrusted to look after the vulnerable, nor should they be entrusted with your taxes to do so.<\/p>\n<p>This industry is nascent, subject to limited oversight, and has begun breeding a plethora of for-profit vultures who have limited ability to actually run a charity or social enterprise.<\/p>\n<p>Scrutiny in these industries should be encouraged.<\/p>\n<p>Viceroy Research is short Home REIT.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>November 23, 2022 \u2013 Home REIT (LSE:HOME) acquires \u201cB&amp;B\u201d accommodation assets and rents them out&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_links_to":"","_links_to_target":""},"categories":[124],"tags":[125],"table_tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v15.6.2 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Home REIT - No place like Home REIT\u2026 thankfully | Viceroy Research<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/2022\/11\/23\/home-reit-no-place-like-home-reit-thankfully\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Home REIT - No place like Home REIT\u2026 thankfully | Viceroy Research\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"November 23, 2022 \u2013 Home REIT (LSE:HOME) acquires \u201cB&amp;B\u201d accommodation assets and rents them out...\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/2022\/11\/23\/home-reit-no-place-like-home-reit-thankfully\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:site_name\" content=\"Viceroy Research\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:published_time\" content=\"2022-11-23T09:32:48+00:00\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:card\" content=\"summary_large_image\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:label1\" content=\"Est. reading time\">\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:data1\" content=\"2 minutes\">\n<script type=\"application\/ld+json\" class=\"yoast-schema-graph\">{\"@context\":\"https:\/\/schema.org\",\"@graph\":[{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/#organization\",\"name\":\"Viceroy Research\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/\",\"sameAs\":[],\"logo\":{\"@type\":\"ImageObject\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/#logo\",\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/cropped-VT-Tulip.png\",\"width\":512,\"height\":512,\"caption\":\"Viceroy Research\"},\"image\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/#logo\"}},{\"@type\":\"WebSite\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/#website\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/\",\"name\":\"Viceroy Research\",\"description\":\"A group of individuals that see the world differently.\",\"publisher\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/#organization\"},\"potentialAction\":[{\"@type\":\"SearchAction\",\"target\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/?s={search_term_string}\",\"query-input\":\"required name=search_term_string\"}],\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\"},{\"@type\":\"WebPage\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/2022\/11\/23\/home-reit-no-place-like-home-reit-thankfully\/#webpage\",\"url\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/2022\/11\/23\/home-reit-no-place-like-home-reit-thankfully\/\",\"name\":\"Home REIT - No place like Home REIT\\u2026 thankfully | Viceroy Research\",\"isPartOf\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/#website\"},\"datePublished\":\"2022-11-23T09:32:48+00:00\",\"dateModified\":\"2022-11-23T09:32:48+00:00\",\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\",\"potentialAction\":[{\"@type\":\"ReadAction\",\"target\":[\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/2022\/11\/23\/home-reit-no-place-like-home-reit-thankfully\/\"]}]},{\"@type\":\"Article\",\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/2022\/11\/23\/home-reit-no-place-like-home-reit-thankfully\/#article\",\"isPartOf\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/2022\/11\/23\/home-reit-no-place-like-home-reit-thankfully\/#webpage\"},\"author\":{\"@id\":\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/#\/schema\/person\/38e10fc7394949cc6e1f60bbc3ac77df\"},\"headline\":\"Home REIT &#8211;
