Azar &#8211; Summary<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>November 4, 2019<\/strong> \u2013 This report provides a deep dive on Athenex\u2019s significant revenue declines and capital over-commitment that investors can expect in the coming months. We believe revenues from the second half of 2019 will fall ~40% against the first half of 2019.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Athenex <strong><u>best seller, Vasopressin, has been pulled due<\/u><\/strong> to FDA ruling brought about by a lawsuit against Athenex by its largest customer, AmerisourceBergen.<\/li>\n<li>COO Jeffrey Yordon is on record as stating the <strong><u>Vasopressin ban<\/u><\/strong><u> <strong>\u201cdid not come unexpected\u201d.<\/strong><\/u><\/li>\n<li>Almirall licensing payments in 2018<strong> <u>were non-recurring,<\/u><\/strong> and 2019 milestones appear to have been delayed as Almirall redefine Athenex deliverables.<\/li>\n<li>Per management\u2019s guidance,<strong> <u>we expect product sales revenue to fall approximately 40% in the second half of 2019 against the first half of 2019.<\/u><\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Athenex have not only <strong>committed &gt;US$1.5b<\/strong> expenditure at their Dunkirk site across the next ten years but are also <strong><u>on the hook for excess development costs for the facility<\/u><\/strong>, whose floorplan has expanded by 28% on-the-fly and falling significantly behind schedule.<\/li>\n<li>Athenex\u2019s new <strong><u>China-funded plant must also generate unrealistic revenues of almost US$1b within 5 years of opening, despite turning over only $160m across the last 5 years combined.<\/u><\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong><u>Athenex must also pay RMB 10b in taxes over 10 years at its China Site,<\/u><\/strong> according to project commitments. Strangely, Athenex\u2019s own tax projections do not meet the required sum from these commitments by over 30%.<\/li>\n<li>To manage its cash burning commitments to major facilities and accelerated R&amp;D, <strong><u>Athenex has issued dilutive equity, and incredulously borrowed US$50m from major investor, Perceptive, at a punitive rate of 11%<\/u><\/strong>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Considering the quantum of issues Viceroy have highlighted, it is alarming to shareholders that Athenex have not addressed a single point of our work. Opting instead to simply state we have published \u201cinaccurate information\u201d. Other commentators have begun to back-test our work<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\"><strong>[1]<\/strong><\/a>.<br \/>\n<strong>Where are the inaccuracies, Athenex?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We have <em>already<\/em> highlighted <strong><u>management\u2019s involvement in Sino Forest, GCL Silicon\/Poly, Suntech, Chelsea Therapeutics, the world\u2019s largest illegal taxol smuggling operation, and now LyphoMed, Gensia and Sagent<\/u><\/strong>. It is mind blowing that Athenex investors would continue to associate with any one of these farces, let alone a collection such as this.<\/p>\n<p>Viceroy reiterate our view that <strong><u>Oraxol is obsolete in the modern medicine<\/u><\/strong>, and that Athenex will be effectively <strong><u>bankrupt by mid-2020 with no profitable operations given management\u2019s overenthusiastic spending habits<\/u><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>Viceroy remain short Athenex, and are in the process of obtaining a compiled, detailed report by industry specialists pertaining to Oraxol and its inability to be commercialized.<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In considering the above, Viceroy estimate that Athenex\u2019s risks of a highly discounted and dilutive capital raise is all but guaranteed.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ahead of this week\u2019s earnings, Viceroy provide an insight of what\u2019s to come.
