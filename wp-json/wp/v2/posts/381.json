These findings demonstrate that AMD\u2019s key products, and it basis for profitability and growth, the EPYC and Ryzen processors, contain severe and pervasive security flaws that put users and organizations at an unacceptable and damaging risk. We understand that these flaws are difficult, some practically impossible, to patch.<br \/>\nWe believe that AMD was compelled to release products as quickly and cheaply as possible as it was falling behind its competitors. This has led to what appears to be complete oversight or negligence of security fundamentals of AMD\u2019s products, which promote an evidently misguided competitive advantage \u2013 particularly with its Secure Processor (a.k.a. Platform Security Processor or PSP) \u2013 of providing \u201cthe greatest peace of mind on every AMD product.\u201d. Nothing could be further from the truth.<br \/>\nViceroy, in consultation with experts, have evaluated CTS\u2019s report. We believe the issues identified by CTS are fatal to AMD on a commercial level, and outright dangerous at an international level.<br \/>\nIn light of CTS\u2019s discoveries, the meteoric rise of AMD\u2019s stock price now appears to be totally unjustified and entirely unsustainable. We believe AMD is worth $0.00 and will have no choice but to file for Chapter 11 (Bankruptcy) in order to effectively deal with the repercussions of recent discoveries.<\/p>\n<p>Date: 13 Mar
