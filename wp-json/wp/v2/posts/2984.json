This deception extends to Chinese press releases.<\/p>\n<p>The site visits were conducted on the week ending November 15, 2019, several months after the announcement of its \u201ccompletion\u201d by Athenex.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The factory is not located in the Chongqing International Bio-City development, but some 25 miles away near Maliuzui toll station.<\/li>\n<li>The building has <strong><u>no sealed road access nor car parking facilities; we were unable to ascertain whether basic utilities had been connected but this seems unlikely<\/u><\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li>Everyone within the facility is still wearing hardhats, and the site is still full of heavy machinery, including cranes. <strong><u>Equipment has yet to be installed \u2013 company statements about validation testing in Q4 2019 are false.<\/u><\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-637\" src=\"https:\/\/viceroyresearch.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/atnx-site.png\" alt=\"ATNX site\" width=\"789\" height=\"570\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong><u>The announcement by Athenex on September 23, 2019 claiming the facility to be complete and in the midst of a validation batch paints a pretty picture, which is completely false.<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>To be clear: <strong><u>there is no completed API Facility<\/u><\/strong>. This fraud mirrors the various sham businesses Athenex\u2019s directors have orchestrated in the past.<\/p>\n<p>On November 19, 2019 Athenex announced the title of their presentation at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. This is a blatant strategy to pump the price of their stock by changing the title of the presentation which has had <strong>no change in content to the one announced on September 23, 2019<\/strong> (ironically, the same date Athenex\u2019s Chongqing plant was allegedly \u201ccompleted\u201d), which was <strong>submitted in June 2019.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In summary:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Abstracts were due by July 8, 2019.<\/li>\n<li>Athenex\u2019s abstract title was announced on September 23, 2019<\/li>\n<li>Athenex changed their abstract title on November 19, 2019<\/li>\n<li>Athenex is not presenting in the Ongoing Clinical Trials category, and therefore cannot have had new information since July 8, 2019.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Athenex\u2019s SABCS presentation is the same as the one announced on September 23. RBC analyst Kennen MacKay\u2019s reiteration of an outperform on a \u201cSABCS win\u201d sounds ridiculous considering that this is the same data that prompted such an unremarkable title 2 months earlier caused the collapse of the stock.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, when Athenex originally announced the presentation, the issues we highlighted in our reports had not yet been brought to light.<\/p>\n<p>We continue to believe investors are being duped by Athenex management through virtually identical charades orchestrated at their previous failed ventures, such as Sino Forest.<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>We have annexed an extended summary of all of Viceroy\u2019s findings, and all of our pictures of Athenex\u2019s actual, unfinished, API plant.<\/u><\/strong><a
